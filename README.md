## What is this?

iOS 10 contains a new speech recognition framework, 'Speech'. The [demo](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/SpeakToMe/) Apple provides requires stopping and starting. It also won't work offline, and recognition seems to time out after a while. This project demonstrates implementing continuous speech recognition.
